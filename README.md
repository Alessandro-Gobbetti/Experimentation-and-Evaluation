# Experimentation and Evaluation
This repository contains the code, data and reports for the Experimentation and Evaluation course.

During the course, we have been asked to perform two experiments. The first one is about the performance of three sorting algorithms from the company Bubble Inc. The second one is about the performance of two naming conventions for variables and functions in programming languages: camelCase and kebab-case.
